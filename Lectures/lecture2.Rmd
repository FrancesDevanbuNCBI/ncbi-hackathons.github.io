# Preamble

## Practice makes perfect

+ Start using [RSeek](http://www.rseek.org) 
+ Other resources on website [http://www.araastat.com/BIOF339_PracticalR](http://www.araastat.com/BIOF339_PracticalR)
+ Beg, Borrow, Steal code that you need 
    
    + R is open-source, so is meant to be shared

## R packages

R packages live on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org) and its mirrors. To install
an R package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('dplyr', repos='http://cran.r-project.org')
```
or

## R Packages

To use a package, or rather, use the functions from the package, you have to load it into R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```
We'll talk about packages later in the semester. 

We will 
concentrate now on what is known as __Base R__, that is, the functions that are available
when R is installed

## Loading data

We will usually load CSV files, since they are the easiest for R. The typical suggestion if you 
have Excel data is to save the sheet as a CSV and then import it into R. 

> You can 
  also load Excel files directly using either the `readxl` or `rio` packages

# The structure of data sets

## Tables
+ Data is typically in a rectangular format
  
    + spreadsheet
    + database table
    + CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files

+ Characteristic
  
    + Rows are observations
    + Columns are variables
    + Each column has the same number of observations

> [__Tidy data__](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) is a particularly amenable format for data analysis.
